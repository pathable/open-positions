Pathable, Inc. is hiring JavaScript developers to join our nomadic team of software craftspeople. We're building from the ground up the second version of our industry leading mobile/web application in Meteor and React. 

Live and work from anywhere, while learning new things, working on a product thousands of people love to use every day. 

Our company is successful, self-funded, profitable, twenty people strong, and growing. We've developed a fantastic culture that embraces adventure in business, engineering and lifestyle. Please join us!

## About Us

Pathable (https://pathable.com/) is the leading provider of mobile event apps and online community platforms for conferences, tradeshows, events, and associations. 

From 10,000 doctors at a convention center to 200 community organizers meeting for a weekend, our software improves the entire experience of attending in-person conferences and events. Though we develop products delivered over the Internet, as a nearly 10 year-old profitable company, we're not quite a startup anymore. 

We're fortunate to have room to innovate and experiment as we develop new products and services. Managed and majority owned by the original founders, we've got the freedom to chart our own course -- our only influence is what's best for our customers. 

From the beginning, our culture has supported and embraced remote workers. We don't have an office and the Pathable family lives or is traveling in over 10 countries. Our members enjoy more time with their children, living in remote and unusual places, or exploring the world; all while growing professionally and building things about which they are proud. 

We're building features in our recently finished new version, it was built from the ground up, using the latest tools available at the time, integrated everything we've learned from nearly 10 years of product development to the same market.

## About our Development area

We have a single product composed of five different Meteor applications including a Mobile Native app.

We use Meteor, MongoDB, React and related technology to develop our second generation Meteor based web and mobile application. 

We deploy code weekly, sometimes daily, to our Galaxy clusters. 

In addition to clear and frequent written communication, we have daily video conferences to design and refine new features for the product. 

## About you
You love to learn and be updated with new technologies, always trying to find better and faster ways to delivery features with great quality.

You thrive in a remote working environment where you define completely your own setup and interact with exclusively via computer; you go wherever you want. You communicate well with the team, the team always knows what you are working on without asking.

You enjoy vigorously defending what you know to be right as much as you enjoy being wrong when the best answer wins. You're loath to have your co-workers discover bugs you've missed.
